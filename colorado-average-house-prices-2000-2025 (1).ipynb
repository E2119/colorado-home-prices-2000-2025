From 2000 to around 2007, home prices increased slowly. There is a clear drop between 2008 and 2011, which matches the U.S. housing market crash during the financial crisis. \nAfter 2012, home prices began to rise again, and the growth became much stronger around 2015. The largest jump happened between 2020 and 2022, where prices increased very quickly. After 2022, the prices show a slight decrease and then level off from 2023 to 2025. \nOverall, the long-term trend shows that home values in Colorado have grown significantly over the last 25 years, with some ups and downs related to economic conditions.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# STEP 10 — Compare Colorado with Washington and Texas (yearly averages)\n\n# Choose states for comparison\nstates = ['Colorado', 'Washington', 'Texas']\n\n# Keep only Date + selected states, drop missing values\nstates_df = df[['Date'] + states].dropna()\n\n# Extract the year\nstates_df['Year'] = states_df['Date'].dt.year\n\n# Group by year and compute average for each state\nstates_yearly = (\n    states_df\n    .groupby('Year')[states]\n    .mean()\n    .reset_index()\n)\n\n# Show the first few rows\nstates_yearly.head()\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-27T04:42:54.917615Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-27T04:42:54.918209Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-27T04:42:54.934040Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-27T04:42:54.918182Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-27T04:42:54.933130Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# STEP 11 — Line chart for Colorado vs Washington vs Texas\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n\nfor s in states:\n    plt.plot(states_yearly['Year'], states_yearly[s], marker='o', linewidth=2, label=s)\n\nplt.title(\"Average Home Values: Colorado vs Washington vs Texas (2000–2025)\", fontsize=16)\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\", fontsize=13)\nplt.ylabel(\"Average Home Price (USD)\", fontsize=13)\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-27T04:42:58.046241Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-27T04:42:58.046834Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-27T04:42:58.270681Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-27T04:42:58.046809Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-27T04:42:58.269945Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This chart compares how home prices changed in Colorado, Washington, and Texas from 2000 to 2025. Washington has the highest prices and shows the fastest growth, especially after 2015, which matches the tech-driven housing boom in the Seattle area. Texas remains the most affordable state, with slower and steadier price increases across the entire period. Colorado starts closer to Texas in the early 2000s but begins rising much faster after 2012. By 2020–2022, Colorado’s trend looks more similar to Washington, showing strong housing demand and rapid price growth. This shift suggests that Colorado has moved from a mid-priced market to a much higher-cost market over the last decade.
