  Basic modeling notebook using Linear Regression to predict Colorado home prices (train: 2000–2019, test: 2020–2025).

- `colorado_zhvi_2000_2025.csv`  
  Yearly average home values for Colorado, created from the original Zillow dataset.

## Project Goal

- Understand long-term housing price trends in Colorado (2000–2025).
